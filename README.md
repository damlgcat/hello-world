Hey guys!

My names Ayaan, and I'm thinking of starting a YouTube channel called 'AyoK'. I've made a logo for it already and it's pretty cool. I live in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. It's an awesome place with sites to see, places to visit, and adventures to be had! I'm thinking of making games for a living so that's pretty cool!
